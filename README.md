## About

This repository showcases my expertise in data science, encompassing various techniques such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and predictive modeling. Each project tackles unique challenges and demonstrates my ability to leverage data-driven insights to drive business growth, operational efficiency, and informed decision-making.

## Projects

### Project 1: Retail Data Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis for a retail chain across 45 outlets using Python. I created 8 pivotal visualizations in a report, uncovering trends that led to a 15% increase in customer retention and 10% sales growth, significantly influencing marketing and operational strategies.

### Project 2: Road Accident Severity Prediction

I leveraged machine learning and neural network techniques to analyze over 150,000 UK road accident records from 2019. By building predictive models, I achieved a 95% accuracy rate in predicting accident severity levels. I also authored a comprehensive report comparing the efficacy of traditional algorithms versus neural networks in predictive accuracy.
